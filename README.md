# PyBer_Analysis
 
## Overview of the analysis
> The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
> The differences between city types is Rural has the least amount of rides, but the highest average fare per ride and driver, where as urban cities have the lowest fare per ride and driver with suburban in the middle of the other two city types.

## Summary
> Based on these results, I would conclude there are a couple of changes to address the differences between city types. 
> - First, lower the cost of rural rides and fare per drivers to make the service more accessable to more income brackets. 
> - Second, I would keep the prices for suburban rides the same, but I would lower the amount of drivers and allocate some of those drivers to the urban cities. 
> - Lastly, I would lower the amound of drivers in urban cities to up the average fare per driver.
